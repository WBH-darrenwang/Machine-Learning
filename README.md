<strong>Univariable_Batch_Gradient_Descent</strong>- a simple program with no user input to teach how to find the linear regression of a relationship between one X data set and one Y data set using gradient descent.
</br></br>
<strong>Multivariable_Batch_Gradient_Descent</strong>- a program that allows users to enter data to find the correlation between it. The user can add as many X categories as they want and the program uses gradient descent to find the line of best fit.
</br></br>
<strong>Normal_Equation_LinReg_Pseudo</strong>- a pseudocode of calculating the line of best fit by using properties like matrix inverses, matrix multiplication, and matrix transpose. This method does not use gradient descent.
</br></br>
<strong>Normal_Equation_LinReg</strong>- allows user to input training examples with as many x categories to find correlation with inputed y values. Takes advantage of python's numpy and normal equation to compute the equation for the line of best fit.
