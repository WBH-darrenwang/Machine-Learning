<strong>SingleXDataset_LinReg_Gradient_Descent</strong>- a simple program with no user input to teach how to find the linear regression of a relationship between one X data set and one Y data set using gradient descent.
</br></br>
<strong>MultipleXDataset_linReg_Gradient_Descent</strong>- a program that allows users to enter data to find the correlation between it. The user can add as many X categories as they want and the program uses gradient descent to find the line of best fit.
